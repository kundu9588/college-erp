To design your app with a **dynamic, user-driven backend** that adapts to various user roles and permissions while providing a smooth frontend experience, follow this layered, modular architecture:

***

## 1. Backend Design (API and Data Model)

### Core Concepts:

- **Central User Model:** One user table with essential profile and authentication data.
- **Dynamic Roles & Permissions:** Separate tables for roles, permissions, and their mappings.
- **Scoped Access:** Permissions linked to specific resources like groups, classes, or departments.
- **Multi-Tenant Support:** All data filtered by `institution_id` to isolate tenant data.
- **Modular Services:** Backend APIs grouped by domain (attendance, fees, exams), all enforcing RBAC.

### Implementation Steps:

- **Authentication Module:** JWT-based login issuing tokens with embedded user ID, institution ID, and roles.
- **Authorization Middleware:** Verify tokens and dynamically check permissions against requested action and resource.
- **User Context Injection:** Middleware adds user, roles, and institution info to each request.
- **Generic APIs:**  
  - Use parameters like `group_id`, `session_id` to scope actions such as taking attendance.
  - Enforce permission checks based on user’s role-permission mappings dynamically.
- **Audit and Logging:** Track actions for security and troubleshooting.

***

## 2. Frontend Design

### Dynamic UI Driven by Roles & Permissions

- **Login & Token Storage:** User logs in to receive JWT token stored securely.
- **Role-Based Rendering:** Frontend fetches and decodes user roles and permissions. UI components and navigation adapt accordingly.
- **API Requests:** Include JWT token for backend authorization.
- **Feature Flags:** Frontend can enable/disable features dynamically based on permissions.
- **Resource Selection:** Users select or access only those groups/classes they have permissions for.

***

## 3. High-level Workflow Flow

```
User opens app
  └── Login with email/password
        └── Receive JWT with roles & institution info
              └── Frontend renders dashboard based on roles
                    └── User performs actions (e.g., attendance)
                          └── API validates permission dynamically
                                └── Backend processes scoped request or rejects unauthorized
```

***

## 4. Benefits

- One backend serves all roles and institutions dynamically.
- No code changes needed to add new roles, permissions, or institution-specific customizations.
- Easy to manage, maintain, and scale.
- Supports future expansion and feature additions seamlessly.

Here is a structured **documentation-style roadmap** for your ERP backend project, organized by folder and file, with goals, completed work, and next steps for each component.

- **Done:** Connection configured using environment variables.
- **Next Steps:** Optimize connection pool for scaling; add migrations config if required.

***

## 2. `migrations/`

- **Goal:** Define and version-control all database schemas.
  
### Files and Status:

- `001_create_institutions_table.js`  
  - Done: Institution schema created and migration tested.

This document can serve as a living guide to track progress, assign work, and onboard new developers effectively.

Would you like me to generate this as a markdown file or expand sections with example code snippets?

User logs in -> receives JWT.
User accesses attendance API with group_id.
Middleware validates JWT, fetches roles & permissions.
Middleware checks user has 'take_attendance' permission.
Middleware verifies user belongs to specified group.
Only if all checks pass, request proceeds.
