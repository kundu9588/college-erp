# College ERP Development Plan & Workflow

I'll help you and your team build a scalable college ERP system with proper collaboration workflows. Here's a complete plan to guide your development from start to finish.

## **Team Collaboration Setup**

### Git Workflow
**Use GitHub Flow with protected main branch:**
- Create feature branches for each task: `git checkout -b feature/student-enrollment`
- Make small, frequent commits with clear messages
- Open pull requests early for review and CI checks
- Merge only after approvals and passing tests

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- Require pull request reviews (at least 1 approval)
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Include administrators in restrictions
- Block direct pushes to main

**Daily Workflow:**
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feature/attendance-tracking

# Work and commit frequently
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add attendance API endpoints"
git push -u origin feature/attendance-tracking

# Open PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create --base main --fill
```

### Code Quality & Standards
**Setup automation:**
- **Husky + Commitlint:** Enforce conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:)
- **ESLint + Prettier:** Consistent code formatting
- **CI Pipeline:** Run tests, lint, build on every PR

**CODEOWNERS file:**
```
# Backend services
/backend/auth/ @auth-team-lead
/backend/student/ @student-team-lead
/frontend/components/ @ui-team-lead
```

## **ERP Architecture Plan**

### **Core System Foundation**
Build a shared foundation that all services use:

**1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Admin, Faculty, Student, Staff
- Session management and audit logging
- Integration with PostgreSQL for user profiles

**2. Common Database Layer**
- Single PostgreSQL database with separate schemas per service
- Shared utilities: connection pooling, migrations, transactions
- Base models and validation helpers
- Audit trail tables for all critical operations

**3. API Gateway & Middleware**
- Express.js with common middleware stack
- Request validation, rate limiting, CORS
- Error handling and logging standardization
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints

**4. Notification System**
- Email/SMS service integration
- Event-driven notifications (enrollment, grades, fees)
- Template management for different message types

## **Service Breakdown & Build Order**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)**
**Core Services:**
1. **Authentication Service**
   - User registration/login
   - Password reset workflows
   - Role assignment and permissions

2. **Student Management**
   - Student profiles and basic information
   - Document upload and management
   - Academic history tracking

### **Phase 2: Academic Core (Weeks 4-7)**
**Services:**
3. **Program & Course Management**
   - Academic programs, courses, prerequisites
   - Curriculum planning and course catalogs

4. **Enrollment System**
   - Course registration with capacity limits
   - Waitlist management
   - Schedule conflict detection

### **Phase 3: Operations (Weeks 8-11)**

5. **Attendance Tracking**
   - Session management and attendance capture
   - Automated reports and alerts
   - Integration with timetables

6. **Assessment & Grading**
   - Assignment creation and submission
   - Grade entry and calculation
   - Transcript generation

### **Phase 4: Financial & Admin (Weeks 12-15)**
**Services:**
7. **Fee Management**
   - Invoice generation and payment tracking
   - Scholarship and discount management
   - Financial reporting

8. **Timetable & Scheduling**
   - Class scheduling with room allocation
   - Conflict resolution
   - Calendar integration

### **Phase 5: Extended Features (Weeks 16+)**
**Services:**
9. **Library Management**
10. **Hostel Management**
11. **Transport Management**
12. **LMS Integration (OneRoster)**

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Database Design**
**Schema Organization:**
```sql
-- Schemas for separation
CREATE SCHEMA auth;      -- Users, roles, permissions
CREATE SCHEMA academic;  -- Programs, courses, enrollments
CREATE SCHEMA finance;   -- Fees, payments, invoices
CREATE SCHEMA operations; -- Attendance, schedules, resources
```

**Core Tables:**
- `auth.users` - Central user registry
- `auth.roles` - Role definitions and permissions
- `academic.students` - Student-specific data
- `academic.programs` - Academic programs
- `academic.courses` - Course catalog
- `academic.enrollments` - Student-course relationships

### **API Structure**
**RESTful endpoints with consistent patterns:**
```
/api/v1/auth/         - Authentication endpoints
/api/v1/students/     - Student management
/api/v1/courses/      - Course operations
/api/v1/enrollments/  - Enrollment management
/api/v1/attendance/   - Attendance tracking
```

### **Frontend Architecture**
**React Structure:**
```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── pages/           # Route-based page components
├── services/        # API client functions
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
├── contexts/        # Global state management
├── utils/           # Helper functions
└── types/           # TypeScript definitions
```

## **Documentation & Workflow**

### **Documentation Stack**
1. **Architecture Docs:** C4 model diagrams in draw.io
2. **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger specs
3. **Process Flows:** Flowcharts for each service workflow
4. **Developer Guide:** Setup, coding standards, deployment

### **Flowchart Standards**
**Use draw.io with consistent symbols:**
- **Oval:** Start/End points
- **Rectangle:** Process steps
- **Diamond:** Decision points
- **Cylinder:** Database operations
- **Parallelogram:** Input/Output

**Example Flow - Student Enrollment:**
```
Start → Validate Student → Check Prerequisites → 
Check Capacity → Create Enrollment → Update Database → 
Send Notification → End
```

### **Team Communication**
**Documentation locations:**
- **GitHub Wiki:** Architecture decisions and setup guides
- **README files:** Per-service documentation
- **Issue templates:** Bug reports and feature requests
- **PR templates:** Review checklists

## **Development Workflow**

### **Sprint Planning (2-week sprints)**
1. **Sprint Planning:** Define user stories and tasks
2. **Daily Standups:** Progress updates and blockers
3. **Sprint Review:** Demo completed features
4. **Retrospective:** Process improvements

### **Definition of Done**
Each feature must have:
- [ ] Code review approval
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] Frontend components styled
- [ ] Security review completed

## **Quality Assurance**

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests:** Jest for business logic
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoint testing
- **E2E Tests:** Cypress for critical user flows
- **Database Tests:** Transaction rollback testing

### **Security Measures**
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention
- Authentication on all protected routes
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits

## **Monitoring & Deployment**

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    - Install dependencies
    - Run linting
    - Run unit tests
    - Run integration tests
  deploy:
    - Build application
    - Deploy to staging
    - Run smoke tests
```

### **Production Readiness**
- Health check endpoints
- Logging and monitoring setup
- Database backup strategies
- Environment configuration management

## **Getting Started**

### **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Set up repository** with branch protection rules
2. **Create project structure** with initial boilerplate
3. **Implement authentication service** as foundation
4. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing
5. **Create first service** (Student Management) following the patterns

### **Team Assignment Suggestions:**

- **Frontend Lead:** React components and state management
- **DevOps Lead:** CI/CD and deployment automation
- **Service Developers:** Individual service implementation
